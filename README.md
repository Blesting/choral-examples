This is a repository containing use cases and examples of choreographies written in the [Choral language](https://choral-lang.org).

In the `choral` folder there are a list of examples of Choral programs:

- BiPair (bipair folder)
- BuyerSellerShipper (buyer-seller-shipper)
- ConsumeItems (consume-items)
- DistAuth (distributed-authentication)
- HelloRoles (hello-roles)
- Karatsuba (karatsuba)
- Mergesort (mergesort)
- Quicksort (quicksort)
- RemoteFunction (remote-function)
- VitalsStreaming (vitals-streaming)

In each folder there is a README file reporting the choral command to compile the choral program contained.

The `java` folder contains Java files useful to compile the choral-compiled programs into executable (binary) code.

That folder is also the target folder of the compilation of the commands reported in each choral program.
